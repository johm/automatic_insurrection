The purpose of this little program is not to expose the seductions of
rhetoric, not to criticize actions taken.  Despite my admiration for
many of the actions taken in the name of insurrection, I'm suspicious
of how easy it is to substitute style for substance in the communiques
describing these actions.  And this is not to say that all
"insurrectionist" texts are meaningless, despite its difficulty, I
found the Coming Insurrection to be, with all its excesses, a serious
(if contentious) contribution to revolutionary thought.  And, to point
out just one other exemplar, the recent "Communique from an Absent
Future: The Terminus of Student Life" is by and large an excellent
piece of analysis.  This program is intended only to demonstrate the
pitfalls of language which sounds too good to be meaningful.
